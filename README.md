# Deep Learning

My name is Oscar Lopez, Iâ€™m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program.

In this activity, I was tasked with building and evaluating deep learning models using both the Fear and Greed Index (FNG) values and simple closing prices for a cryptocurrency coin (Bitcoin) to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for Crypto than the normal closing data.


I used the skills learned in the class last week, I prepared the data for training and testing, built and trained custom LSTM RNNs, evaluated the performance of each model and visualized using hvplot.


In this assignment, I used the class exercises and google, specially stackoverflow to complete both start codes in the instructions and resolve the challenges I had, particularly with Google Colab as I was not too familiar with its imports and settings.
